In the past 12 months I** have…

Finished two [projects](http://lncd.lincoln.ac.uk/projects/) and started another three; brought in £423K of funding to the university, which created three jobs and fully funded two Masters students; appealed for, set up and co-ordinated a cross-university 'technology for education' [group](http://lncd.lincoln.ac.uk); organised a [conference](http://devxs.org); [wrote](http://lncn.eu/ep/002210) two book chapters, one journal paper and one national newspaper article; constituted a [co-operative](http://socialsciencecentre.org.uk) and successfully closed a [website](http://writetoreply.org). I also got a new job, started teaching, started a PGCE and gave seven public talks and presentations about my work. Alongside this, I continue to run the university WordPress publishing [platform](http://blogs.lincoln.ac.uk). I was also very pleased to help Tony Hirst be [made](http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2011/10/21/tony-hirst-senior-visiting-fellow/) Visiting Senior Fellow in Networked Teaching and Learning at Lincoln.

In 2012 I want to do fewer things but do them better, spend more time with Sue and Gracie, read more fiction, and make things.

  ** of course, in most cases I did this in collaboration with, and greatly benefitted from the help of, friends and colleagues.
