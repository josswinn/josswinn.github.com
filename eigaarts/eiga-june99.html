</p>
<p class="c3">
	24 frames per second (1975-8, 16mm, 12mins) 
</p>
<p class="c4">
	"Both in terms of its examination of time and space, of light and darkness, of visuals and sounds; and in terms of its demands and potential rewards for an audience...[24fps] is a quintessential Iimura film." (Scott MacDonald) 
</p>
<p class="c3">
	MA: Space/Time In The Garden of Ryoan-ji (1989, 16mm, 16mins)

</p>
<p class="c3">
	Moments At The Rock (1985, videotape, 11mins) 
</p>
<p class="c4">

<br />
<hr />
<p class="c2">
	"From the early sixties, though Japanese, Iimura was well known as one of the first generation of the New York Underground - for many years, Japanese experimental film was Takahiko Iimura." (Programme notes by Malcolm Le Grice for Iimura retrospective, The LUX Centre, London, 1998.) 
</p>
<p class="c2">
	"Iimura's work has continued to open up new ground...he is a significant and singular film maker but also one of the most important conceptual artists working in any medium. (Le Grice, 1975.) 
</p>
<p class="c2">
	"Iimura Takahiko is not an ordinary artist. He is undoubtedly one of the first, along with Yoko Ono and Ryuichi Sakamoto to gain substantial international reputation." (Carl Eugene Loeffler, Media Critic, San Francisco). 
</p>
<p class="c2">
	"Although Takahiko Iimura was, and continues to be, an active part of the New York avant-garde scene, he always remained an enigmatic, mysterious presence, pursuing his own unique route through the very center of the avant-garde cinema...he explored this direction of cinema in greater depth than anyone else...[Seeing his work] is an important occasion for all concerned with the development and pleasures of cinema as an art." (Jonas Mekas). 
</p>
<p class="c2">
	"One of the foremost video and film artists in the world" (Studio 200 Exhibition programme notes, 1991). 
</p>
<p class="c2">
